# Homework #4

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Callback Functions
		// Any function passed as an argument into another function's parameters
	* Closure
		// Both the function itself and the scope in which the function was declared.
	* `arguments`
		// Something you pass into a functions parameters.
	* Recursion
		// The concept that the solution to a larger problem depends on the solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. 
	* `prototype`
		// Almost all objects have one. A prototype is the backup parachute full of properties and methods that don't exist on the surface level. When you ask an object for a property, it checks the first surface level, followed by the deeper prototype level.
	* Constructors
		// Used to create a more template-form version of ojbects with which to work from. 


2. Fork and clone this repo.  When you need to commit use the following commands.
		
	* `git status`
	* `git add --all`
	* `git status`
	* `git commit -m "your commit message"`
	* `git push origin master`

3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.  Run tests using `npm test`.

4. Make the tests pass!
